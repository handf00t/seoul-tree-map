# Why Are the Street Trees in Our Neighborhood Those Specific Trees?

**Street Tree Complete Guide Series #2**

---

## Street Trees Aren't Just Any Random Trees

Cherry trees in front of schools, ginkgo trees on major roads, zelkova trees in apartment complexes... Have you noticed? Different trees are planted as street trees depending on the location.

They don't just plant any random tree - they carefully select them considering various factors. In Korea, there are as many as 160 species of trees that can be used as street trees!

## What Criteria Are Used to Select Street Trees?

When selecting street trees, these factors are considered:

**First, whether the tree is well-suited to the local climate and soil.** You wouldn't plant cold-sensitive trees in cold regions, right?

**Second, whether it matches the local history and culture.** In old villages, trees that have grown in that region for a long time are more suitable.

**Third, whether it harmonizes well with the surrounding landscape.** Areas with tall buildings and low residential neighborhoods require different types of trees.

**Fourth, whether it has any negative effects on people's health.** Trees that cause severe allergies should be avoided.

**Fifth, whether it helps with air purification or temperature regulation.** These are important roles of street trees!

## Each Tree Has Its Own Personality

Trees, like people, each have different personalities. Some trees are resistant to exhaust fumes, while others are sensitive. Some trees withstand cold well, while others cannot.

### Trees Resistant to Pollution vs. Sensitive Trees

Major city roads have lots of cars and therefore lots of exhaust fumes. So pollution-resistant trees must be planted.

Trees resistant to pollution include ginkgo trees, zelkova trees, London plane trees, and Japanese pagoda trees. On the other hand, pine trees, cherry trees, hawthorns, and katsura trees are sensitive to pollution, so they're rarely planted on busy roads.

### Cold-Resistant Trees vs. Cold-Sensitive Trees

Crepe myrtles and Chinese pistache trees are sensitive to cold. So they're only planted in places where special winter care can be provided.

### Trees with Spreading Root Systems

Some trees don't send their roots deep underground but spread them horizontally. These are called "shallow-rooted trees." If you plant these trees, their roots can push up the sidewalk pavement, making it bumpy.

## Different Trees Are Planted Based on Location

### Commercial Areas (Places with Many Shops)

What's most important in areas with many shops? Making sure signs aren't blocked! So trees are planted that don't spread their branches too wide horizontally and have high lower branches.

Trees like ginkgo, Chinese fringe tree, horse chestnut, zelkova, and Japanese pagoda tree work well.

### Office Districts

In areas with tall buildings, large, majestic trees that complement the buildings are preferred. These include ginkgo trees, zelkova trees, Chinese fringe trees, Japanese pagoda trees, and dawn redwoods.

### Around Apartment Complexes

Around apartments, trees that provide good shade and are visually appealing are planted. Popular choices include zelkova, hackberry, Japanese pagoda tree, Chinese fringe tree, maple, and Yoshino cherry trees.

### Historical Sites and Tourist Attractions

In old palaces and tourist sites, traditional trees that match the local atmosphere are planted. These include ginkgo trees, Japanese cornel, pine trees, hawthorn trees, and elm trees.

### Roads Connected to Forests

On roads next to mountains or parks, trees that bear fruit for birds and squirrels are planted. These include Chinese fringe tree, Japanese pagoda tree, Japanese cornel, hawthorn, and Korean mountain ash.

---

## Different Trees Are Planted Based on Road Width

### Wide Roads (40m or more)

On really large roads, big trees that grow to 25m or taller when mature are planted. They create important urban landscapes. These include ginkgo trees, zelkova trees, Japanese pagoda trees, and London plane trees.

### Medium Roads (25-40m)

Trees that grow to about 15-20m tall are planted, such as ginkgo, dogwood, ash, hackberry, tulip tree, and Chinese fringe tree.

### Narrow Roads (25m or less)

On narrow roads, relatively smaller trees are planted. These include Japanese cornel, maple, magnolia, and goldenrain tree.

---

## Sidewalk Width Also Matters

If sidewalks are narrow (less than 3m), small trees with branches that don't spread much are planted. These include Korean mountain ash, kousa dogwood, hawthorn, and crepe myrtle.

If sidewalks are wide (5m or more), large trees that provide lots of shade can be planted. These include ginkgo trees, hackberry, zelkova, and Japanese pagoda trees.

---

## Areas with Power Lines Are Special

In areas where power lines pass through, trees that grow too tall can't be planted. As trees grow, they might touch the electrical wires. So smaller trees are planted in these areas, such as Japanese cornel, kousa dogwood, crepe myrtle, and rose of Sharon.

## Qualities of Good Street Trees

Trees used as street trees aren't just randomly selected and planted. There are quality standards.

**To be a good street tree:**
- The tree shape should be attractive and healthy
- Branches and leaves should be appropriately dense
- There should be no pest or disease damage
- Roots should be well-developed
- Lower branches should be at a certain height so people can pass by comfortably

## Fun Facts

**Male and female ginkgo trees are planted selectively!** Have you ever smelled ginkgo fruit? It's terribly foul, right? So in areas where many people pass by, male trees that don't bear fruit are specifically chosen.

**Fast-growing trees aren't planted near power lines!** Trees like dawn redwoods grow quickly, so they're avoided in areas with electrical wires.

## Conclusion

Now when you walk down the street and see street trees, think "Why is this particular tree here?" There's definitely a reason. Road width, sidewalk width, surrounding buildings, presence of power lines... Various factors are considered to select the perfect tree for that specific location!
