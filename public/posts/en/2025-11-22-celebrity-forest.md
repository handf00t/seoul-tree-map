# Celebrity Forests: What Role Do Trees Planted with Fan Love Play in Cities?


---

## Why Are Celebrity Names in Parks?

When walking through Hangang Park or downtown parks,  
you've probably seen signs with names like "○○ Forest" or "△△ Star Forest."

It feels a bit unfamiliar at first.  
You might think, "Why are celebrity names in parks?"

These forests are usually **urban forests created when fans pool their money together to plant trees**.  
This type of forest creation is becoming increasingly common in Seoul these days.

---

## What Are Celebrity Forests?

Celebrity forests are **urban forests created under the name of specific celebrities**.  
They're mostly led by fans who donate trees and work with Seoul City or environmental organizations to create them.

The important point is that
- They're not forests directly created by the celebrities themselves, but rather  
- **Citizen (fan) participatory tree donation-type urban forests**.

So structurally speaking, celebrity forests are also  
close to being **one form of general urban forest creation projects**.

---

## How Are Celebrity Forests Created?

The process is simpler than you might think.

### 1. Fans Plan Tree Donations

Usually around a celebrity's birthday or debut anniversary,  
fans gather to collect opinions about planting trees.

The money raised at this time is used for
- Purchasing seedlings
- Planting costs
- Making information signs, etc.

---

### 2. Consultation with Environmental Organizations and Seoul City

In Seoul, they mainly work with
- Environmental organizations (e.g., Seoul Environmental Union)
- Seoul City (Hangang Park, Parks and Green Space departments)

to proceed with forest creation.

They review together where to plant,  
what types of trees are suitable,  
and whether there are any issues with city management.

---

### 3. Actually Plant Trees in Parks

Once approval is granted, **tree planting events** are sometimes held  
where fans and citizens participate together.

Seoul City takes charge of
- Providing the site
- Basic management
- Ongoing maintenance and care

while  
fans directly participate in forest creation.

---

## So Are There Actually Real Effects?

Celebrity forests are ultimately **trees planted in cities**.  
So what they do isn't much different from general urban forests.

---

### 1. They Absorb Carbon

Trees absorb carbon dioxide as they grow.  
While the effect of a single tree may seem small,  
when multiple forests come together, they make a clear difference for the entire city.

---

### 2. They Reduce the Heat Island Effect

Forests created along the Han River or in parks
- Provide shade in summer and
- Help lower surrounding temperatures.

Especially when trees are introduced to spaces that only had grass,  
the perceived temperature changes significantly.

---

### 3. They Become Shelters for Urban Wildlife

Forests planted with shrubs and trees together  
become **small habitats** for urban wildlife like birds and insects.

They also serve as  
**green corridors** connecting park to park.

---

## The Biggest Characteristic of Celebrity Forests

Looking at environmental effects alone,  
celebrity forests aren't forests with particularly special technology.

But there's one clear difference.

👉 **"Who started it"**

Celebrity forests
- Started not from administration, but
- From voluntary citizen participation.

Interest → Participation → Actual planting  
Through this process,  
urban forests become not 'someone else's business' but 'spaces I helped create.'

---

## Why These Forests Are Increasing

The reason celebrity forests are increasing is simple.

- Fan activities changed from merchandise to **action**, and
- That action could be connected with city policy.

From the city's perspective, they can
- Secure additional green space and
- Increase citizen participation

From citizens' perspective,
- They can change the city in meaningful ways.

---

## Conclusion

Celebrity forests may seem special,  
but ultimately they're **just another tree planted in the city**.

However, what's different is that these trees
- Started from someone's interest and
- Were created through many people's choices.

Next time you see a celebrity forest in a park,  
it might be nice to think  
"Who planted this tree, and why?"
