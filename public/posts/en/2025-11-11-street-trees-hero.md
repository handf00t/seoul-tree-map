## Isn't it just a tree?

The trees you always see on the way to school or on the way to catch the bus. What do we call these trees that provide cool shade in the summer and show pretty fall foliage in the fall?

It is a ‘street tree’. Street trees are the green space that we can most easily see around us. These are trees that were not just planted, but intentionally planted to make the city more livable.

## What are street trees?

There is a definition established by law. Trees planted next to roads or sidewalks are called street trees. We plant them to create a pretty landscape, clean the air, and provide cool shade.

But the trees on the highway are not street trees! The law says that highways are excluded.

## What street trees do

Street trees do a lot more than you might think. Let’s take a look at them one by one.

### 1. Keep drivers safe

When the road curves or has ups and downs, if the trees stand regularly, the driver can know in advance, “Oh, the road turns there.” Even when the fog is thick or there is a lot of snow, trees play a role in showing the way.

If it suddenly gets dark when you enter a tunnel, it takes time for your eyes to adjust, right? The street trees near the tunnel gradually create shade, helping your eyes adjust slowly.

Even when the lights of cars coming from the opposite direction are dazzling at night, the trees block the street. And if the car goes off the road, the tree absorbs the impact more gently than the guardrail.

### 2. Cool down the city

Do you know why the city is so hot in the summer? Concrete buildings and asphalt roads hold a lot of heat. This is called the ‘heat island effect’. This means that the city becomes like a hot island.

Street trees prevent this heat island effect. In the summer, it blocks direct sunlight to keep you cool, and in the winter, it prevents you from getting too cold.

### 3. Catch fine dust

Street trees remove fine dust in three ways.

First, as we breathe in air through very small holes (stomata) in leaves, we also suck in fine dust. Second, fine dust sticks to small hairs or sticky parts on the surface of leaves. Third, the dust accumulated on the leaves is washed away when it rains.

### 4. Clean the air

Trees take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen. The same goes for street trees. It absorbs bad substances contained in car exhaust and makes the air clean.

### 5. Reduce the noise

Trees block loud noises from the road. Leaves and branches absorb sound. So even if you live next to the road, it will be a little less noisy.

### 6. Make the city pretty

Street trees make the city pretty. There are also famous tree-lined streets like Yeouido Cherry Blossom Road and Deoksugung Stone Wall Road with ginkgo trees. It also becomes a symbol representing the neighborhood.

### 7. It becomes a home for animals

There aren't many forests in the city. So, street trees become homes for animals such as birds and squirrels. It also serves as a bridge connecting parks between parks. Animals can move along the street trees.

## fun facts

When building a new road, street trees must also be planted. It’s stipulated by law! When designing roads, space for planting trees must be created in advance.

And the street trees are managed by the district mayor. Since 2006, each local district office has been responsible for managing it.
