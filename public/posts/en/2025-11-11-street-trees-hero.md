# The Trees I See Every Day on My Commute Were Actually Urban Heroes All Along

**Street Trees Complete Guide Series #1**

## They're Just Trees, Right?

Those trees you always see on your way to school or while heading to catch the bus. The ones that provide cool shade in summer and beautiful fall colors in autumn - what do we call these trees?

They're called 'street trees.' Street trees are the most easily accessible green spaces around us. They're not just randomly planted - they're trees deliberately planted to make cities more livable.

## What Exactly Are Street Trees?

There's actually a legal definition for them. Trees planted along roadsides or sidewalks are called street trees. They're planted to create beautiful landscapes, clean the air, and provide cool shade.

But trees on highways don't count as street trees! The law specifically excludes highways.

## What Street Trees Do

Street trees do way more work than you'd think. Let's take a look at each function:

### 1. They Keep Drivers Safe

When roads curve or have hills, trees standing in regular patterns help drivers think "Oh, the road turns there" and prepare in advance. Even when fog is thick or it's snowing heavily, trees serve as guides along the road.

You know how when you enter a tunnel and it suddenly gets dark, your eyes need time to adjust? Street trees near tunnels gradually create shade so your eyes can slowly adapt.

When oncoming headlights are blinding at night, street trees block them too. And if a car veers off the road, trees absorb impact more gently than guardrails.

### 2. They Cool Down Cities

Do you know why cities get so hot in summer? It's because concrete buildings and asphalt roads store tons of heat. This is called the 'heat island effect' - meaning cities become like hot islands.

Street trees prevent this heat island effect. In summer, they block direct sunlight to keep things cool, and in winter, they prevent it from getting too cold.

### 3. They Catch Fine Dust

Street trees eliminate fine dust in three ways.

First, they suck in fine dust along with air through tiny holes in their leaves (stomata). Second, fine dust sticks to small hairs or sticky parts on leaf surfaces. Third, dust that accumulates on leaves gets washed away when it rains.

### 4. They Clean the Air

Trees breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, right? Street trees do the same thing. They also absorb harmful substances from car exhaust, making the air cleaner.

### 5. They Reduce Noise

Trees block the loud sounds from roads. Leaves and branches absorb sound. That's why it's a bit less noisy even when you live next to a road.

### 6. They Make Cities Beautiful

Street trees make cities prettier. There are famous street tree-lined roads like Yeouido's cherry blossom path and the ginkgo trees along Deoksugung stone wall path. They sometimes become symbols representing their neighborhoods.

### 7. They Become Homes for Animals

There aren't many forests in cities, right? So street trees become homes for animals like birds and squirrels. They also act as bridges connecting parks to each other. Animals can move along the street trees.

## Fun Facts

When building new roads, street trees must be planted too. It's required by law! Space for planting trees must be planned from the road design stage.

And street trees are managed by district mayors. Since 2006, each local district office has been responsible for managing them.

## Wrapping Up

Don't street trees look different to you now when you see them on the street? They might just seem to be standing there, but they're actually urban heroes doing tons of work for us!
