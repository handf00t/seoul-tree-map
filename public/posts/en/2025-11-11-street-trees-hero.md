# That Tree I See Every Day on My Commute? Turns Out It's a City Hero

**Street Tree Complete Guide Series #1**

## Just a Tree, Right?

Those trees you always see on the way to school or while walking to the bus stop. The ones that give us cool shade in summer and show off beautiful fall colors in autumn - what do we call these trees?

They're called 'street trees.' Street trees are the most easily accessible green spaces around us. They're not just randomly planted - these are trees deliberately planted to make our cities more livable.

## What Exactly Are Street Trees?

There's actually a legal definition for them. Street trees are trees planted along roadsides or sidewalks. They're planted to create beautiful landscapes, clean the air, and provide cool shade.

But trees on highways don't count as street trees! The law specifically excludes highways.

## What Street Trees Do for Us

Street trees do way more than you might think. Let's take a look at each job they do:

### 1. They Keep Drivers Safe

When roads curve or have hills, trees standing in regular patterns help drivers think "Oh, the road turns up ahead" and prepare in advance. Even in thick fog or heavy snow, trees serve as guides along the road.

You know how when you enter a tunnel, it gets suddenly dark and your eyes need time to adjust? Street trees near tunnels gradually create shade, helping your eyes adjust slowly.

When oncoming headlights are blinding at night, street trees block that glare. And if a car goes off the road, trees absorb impact more gently than guardrails do.

### 2. They Cool Down the City

Do you know why cities get so hot in summer? Concrete buildings and asphalt roads store massive amounts of heat. This is called the 'heat island effect' - meaning cities become like hot islands.

Street trees prevent this heat island effect. In summer, they block direct sunlight to keep things cool, and in winter, they prevent it from getting too cold.

### 3. They Catch Fine Dust

Street trees eliminate fine dust in three ways.

First, they suck in fine dust along with air through tiny pores (stomata) in their leaves. Second, fine dust sticks to small hairs or waxy surfaces on the leaves. Third, dust that accumulates on leaves gets washed away when it rains.

### 4. They Clean the Air

Trees breathe in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, right? Street trees do the same thing. They also absorb harmful substances from car exhaust, cleaning the air.

### 5. They Reduce Noise

Trees block the loud sounds from roads. Leaves and branches absorb sound. That's why it's a bit quieter even when you live next to a road.

### 6. They Make the City Beautiful

Street trees beautify cities. We have famous tree-lined streets like the cherry blossom road at Yeouido and the ginkgo trees along Deoksugung stone wall path. They even become symbols representing their neighborhoods.

### 7. They Become Homes for Animals

Cities don't have many forests, right? So street trees become homes for animals like birds and squirrels. They also act as bridges connecting parks to each other. Animals can move along the street trees.

## Fun Facts

When building new roads, street trees must be planted too. It's required by law! Space for planting trees must be planned from the road design stage.

And street trees are managed by district mayors. Since 2006, each local district office has been responsible for managing them.

## Wrapping Up

Now when you see street trees on the street, don't they look different? They might seem like they're just standing there, but they're actually city heroes doing tons of work for us!
