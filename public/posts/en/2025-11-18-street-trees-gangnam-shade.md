# Where to Walk During Heat Waves? Complete Shade Analysis of Gangnam's Big 3 Districts


---

## Where Will You Walk on Summer Days?

On a summer day when heat wave warnings are issued, which area should you walk through to stay cool among Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, and Songpa-gu?

"Obviously where there are lots of street trees!"

Is that really true? The truth that data reveals is a bit different.

For reference, according to a Seoul Institute (2022) study, street tree shade **reduces the temperature of surrounding objects by 15.4 degrees**.

## Reversed Rankings: Surprising Results

### Street Tree Count Rankings
```
1st Gangnam-gu: 12,803 trees
2nd Songpa-gu: 12,717 trees  
3rd Seocho-gu: 11,786 trees
```

The **number of analyzed street trees across the three districts is similar**. The difference between Gangnam-gu with the most trees and Seocho-gu with the fewest is about 1,000 trees.

### Shade Coverage Rankings
```
1st Seocho-gu: 87.3%
2nd Songpa-gu: 85.1%
3rd Gangnam-gu: 80.3%
```

But when we look at shade coverage rates, the rankings are reversed.

**Seocho-gu, which has the fewest street trees, provides the most shade, while Gangnam-gu, which has the most trees, provides the least shade.** How did this happen?

---

## The Secret Was in the Size of Street Trees

The answer lies in the **size of street trees**.

| District | Average Crown Width | Number of Trees | Shade Coverage |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Seocho-gu | **5.6m** | 11,786 trees | 87.3% |
| Gangnam-gu | 5.2m | 12,803 trees | 80.3% |
| Songpa-gu | **4.3m** | 12,717 trees | 85.1% |

Crown width refers to the spread of street tree branches and leaves. It's an important value that determines the size of shade created by street trees.

The average crown width of Seocho-gu's street trees is 5.6m. Songpa-gu's is 4.3m. It's only a 1.3m difference, but this creates a big difference.

**How is shade area calculated?**

The shade created by a single street tree is assumed to be circular. We calculate the area of a circle with crown width as the radius. (This is professionally called Crown Projection Area, or CPA for short)

```
One street tree with 5.6m crown width = about 24.6㎡ (7.5 pyeong) of shade
One street tree with 4.3m crown width = about 14.5㎡ (4.4 pyeong) of shade
```

The shade difference per street tree is about **10㎡ (3 pyeong)**.

Why is this important? According to Nature (2014) research, **one large tree absorbs as much carbon per year as several medium-sized trees combined**. Frontiers in Forests (2020) research also revealed that large trees comprise only 3% of the total but **store 42% of carbon**.

Large street trees are superior not only for shade but also for environmental effects.

## Seocho-gu: The Power of Large Street Trees

Seocho-gu demonstrates a **"grow rather than plant"** strategy.

### Seocho-gu's Top 5 Roads for Shade Excellence

| Road | Shade Coverage | Number of Trees | Average Crown Width |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Heonneung-ro | 112.3% | 370 trees | 6.6m |
| Jamwon-ro | 103.3% | 195 trees | **10.0m** |
| Seonbawi-gil | 99.3% | 142 trees | 7.5m |
| Gangnam-daero | 95.3% | 875 trees | 6.7m |
| Banpo-ro | 88.9% | 614 trees | 6.5m |

Let's look at Jamwon-ro. It has only 195 street trees but achieves 103.3% shade coverage. How can it exceed 100%?

Because the street trees are so large that their shadows overlap. The average crown width per street tree is 10.0m. Each street tree creates 78㎡ (24 pyeong) of shade.

### Seocho-gu's Success Story: Yangjae Stream Metasequoia Avenue

There's a representative case showing how successful Seocho-gu's "growing" strategy is. It's the **Yangjae Stream Metasequoia Avenue**.

- Length: About 3.5km
- Street trees: About 830 trees
- Achievement: Selected as **'Korea's 100 Beautiful Roads'**

The street trees that were carefully nurtured over a long time have now become a Seoul landmark. This is a good example of successful "grow rather than plant" strategy.

### Characteristics of Seocho-gu

- Average crown width of 5.6m, ranking 1st among Gangnam's 3 districts
- Plants fewer street trees but grows them large
- Success story of "grow rather than plant" strategy
- Excellent and stable shade quality (lowest Very Poor sections at 4.8%)
- According to Kyunghyang Newspaper (2021), London plane trees are well established, creating "good noise prevention effects and providing large shade to the city"

*This interactive map visualizes the shade connectivity of Seoul's street trees. Roads are color-coded from green (excellent) to red (vulnerable) based on shade coverage ratio, and line thickness represents street tree density. Click on the map to see detailed information including number of trees, average crown width, and shade distance for each section.*

**Important Notes for Interpretation:**
- Shade ranges are estimated values based on street tree crown width data, and actual shade may vary depending on season, time of day, and solar elevation.
- This visualization analyzes only street tree shade and does not reflect shade from buildings or structures.
- Since both sides of roads (A side/B side) were analyzed separately, shade conditions may differ by direction even for roads with the same name.

## Songpa-gu: The Power of Dense Planting

Songpa-gu demonstrates a **"small but many"** strategy.

```
Songpa-gu characteristics:
- Number of trees: 12,717 trees (2nd place)
- Average crown width: 4.3m (3rd place, smallest)
- Shade coverage: 85.1% (2nd place)
```

With the smallest average crown width, how could it maintain 2nd place in shade coverage?

### Songpa-gu's Excellent Shade Roads

| Road | Shade Coverage | Number of Trees |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Olympic-ro | 97.9% | 217 trees |
| Sinjeon-dong-gil | 96.7% | 38 trees |
| Gyotong Park-gil | 95.2% | 94 trees |

The secret is **dense planting intervals**. Songpa-gu's average street tree spacing is 6.73m, about 1m narrower than Gangnam-gu (7.65m). Though crown width is small (4.3m), they secured shade continuity by planting trees at narrow intervals without gaps.

### Characteristics of Songpa-gu

- Overcame crown width limitations by planting small street trees at regular intervals
- Highest ratio of Excellent grade (shade coverage 95% or higher) at 70.3% among the 3 districts!
- Provides stable shade in many sections

## Gangnam-gu: Most Street Trees, Diverse Planting History

Gangnam-gu has the most street trees but the lowest shade quality.

### History of Gangnam-gu's Street Trees

Gangnam-gu has had systematic street tree planting since the Gangnam development period of the 1970s. When the environment became barren due to rapid urban development at the time, the government mainly planted London plane trees along major roads.

In the mid-1980s, Sinsa-dong residents voluntarily planted 147 ginkgo trees, creating the current 'Sinsa-dong Tree-lined Street'. This was a case of resident-led street tree creation and remains a representative landmark of Gangnam-gu to this day.

### Gangnam-gu's Paradox

There's an interesting fact. According to Newsis reports, Gangnam-gu has **23,729 street trees, the most among Seoul's 25 districts**. This is much more than the 12,803 trees included in our analysis.

Despite having many street trees, it has the lowest shade coverage. The main cause appears to be the wide average spacing of 7.65m.

### Gangnam-gu by Numbers

| Indicator | Value | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Average spacing | **7.65m** | Wider than Seocho-gu and Songpa-gu (6.73m) |
| Shade coverage | 80.3% | 1 out of 5 steps in sunlight |
| Very Poor ratio | **10.3%** | Double that of Seocho-gu (4.8%) |

Gangnam-gu's street tree spacing averages 7.65m, about 1m wider than Seocho-gu and Songpa-gu (6.73m). Wide spacing makes it easy for shade connections to break.

### Analysis of Gangnam-gu's Shade-Vulnerable Roads

| Road | Shade Coverage | Exposed Distance | Characteristics |
|------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Rodeo-gil | 41.6% | 147m | Commercial district nature |

**Rodeo-gil** is a commercial center street densely packed with food, fashion, and shopping facilities. Buildings are closely arranged, creating a structure where space for planting street trees is inherently limited.

## How Good is the Shade Quality?

We graded each district's roads by shade quality.

| Grade | Criteria | Seocho-gu | Songpa-gu | Gangnam-gu |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Excellent | 95% or higher | 69.1% | **70.3%** | 61.5% |
| Good | 85-95% | 7.0% | 6.0% | 6.4% |
| Fair | 70-85% | 11.7% | 9.9% | 9.8% |
| Poor | 50-70% | 7.3% | 8.5% | 12.0% |
| Very Poor | Under 50% | **4.8%** | 5.3% | **10.3%** |

**Songpa-gu**: Highest Excellent grade ratio at 70.3%. 7 out of 10 roads have excellent shade!

**Seocho-gu**: Lowest Very Poor grade ratio at 4.8%. Most stable shade quality.

**Gangnam-gu**: Highest Very Poor grade ratio at 10.3%. Many roads urgently need improvement.

## Key Summary

### What This Analysis Reveals

**1. Size Matters More Than Quantity**

Even with similar numbers of street trees, shade quality differs. What's important is the size (crown width) and arrangement of street trees.

Seocho-gu has about 1,000 fewer trees (11,786 vs 12,803) but has an average crown width 0.4m larger (5.6m vs 5.2m). This small difference created a 7 percentage point difference in shade coverage.

This isn't just our opinion. **University of Melbourne research (2024)** simulated 30 years and found that strategies maximizing the number of street trees achieved 11-15% canopy coverage, but **strategies prioritizing large crown species achieved 16-22%**. This is scientific evidence that planting large street trees is more effective.

**2. Two Success Strategies**

- Seocho-gu: Growing large street trees (average crown width 5.6m)
- Songpa-gu: Dense planting of small street trees (12,717 trees)

Both strategies have their own advantages. What's important is not "planting many" but **"how to plant and how to grow"**.

**3. "Grow Rather Than Plant" is Seoul City's Policy Direction**

The core of the **2040 Seoul Park and Green Space Master Plan (conditionally passed in February 2025)** is "not quantitative expansion of park area but **qualitative improvement of green spaces**". Seoul Environmental Union (2025) also proposed "shifting management methods from expert-led creation and pruning to **resident-participating care-focused approaches**".

Our analysis's "grow rather than plant" proposal aligns exactly with this policy direction.

## Fun Facts

**Shade coverage can exceed 100%**

When street tree shadows overlap, it can exceed 100%. Seocho-gu's Heonneung-ro is at 112.3%, meaning shadows overlap by 12.3%. This creates darker, cooler shade.

This might seem strange, but it's actually an academically recognized concept. According to the **RISC (Range Inventory Standardization Committee)** official definition, "Canopy cover can exceed 100%".

**The Magic of Street Tree Size**

Street tree with 5.6m crown width = about 24.6㎡ (7.5 pyeong) of shade
Street tree with 4.3m crown width = about 14.5㎡ (4.4 pyeong) of shade

It's only a 1.3m difference, but the shade area differs by 10㎡ (3 pyeong).

**Amazing Abilities of Large Street Trees**

According to Nature (2014) research, the larger the tree, the more carbon it absorbs per year (confirmed in 97% of species). Frontiers in Forests (2020) research revealed something even more surprising:

- Large street trees (diameter 53cm or larger) comprise only **3%** of the total
- But they store **42%** of carbon

This is scientific evidence that one large street
